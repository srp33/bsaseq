This docker is based on the protocol in the following paper:
Bulked-Segregant Analysis Coupled to Whole Genome Sequencing (BSA-Seq) for Rapid Gene Cloning in Maize

This docker takes in two files containing forward and reverse Illumina reads,
and returns pileup files you can use to plot your data in R, as well as data
files containing information on genes with EMS-based SNPs and their predicted
impact.

We would recommend using R code such as that at the end of this file to visually
analyze your data, and then subset the data in the other files to analyze your
region of interest. This can be done in Excel by using the gene ID column.

R Code:

pileup_df <- read.csv(inputPileupName, header=FALSE, sep='\t', quote="", colClasses=c("NULL", NA, "NULL", "NULL", "NULL", "NULL", "NULL", "NULL", "NULL", "NULL", "NULL", "NULL", NA))
colnames(pileup_df) <- c("position","f_variant")
chr <- "ADD CHROMOSOME NUMBER HERE"
hplot <- ggplot( subset(pileup_df, f_variant >= 1.00), aes(x=position)) + 
	geom_histogram(binwidth=1000000) +
	scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0), breaks=seq(min(0), max(pileup_df$position), by=20000000)) + 
	scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) + 
	ggtitle(paste("Chr. ", chr, " Frequency of the Frequency of Deviants = 1.00", sep='')) + 
	theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, face="bold"), axis.text.x=element_text(angle=70, hjust=1))
	
ggsave( hplot, filename=outPDFname, device="pdf", units="in", width=10, height=10 )
